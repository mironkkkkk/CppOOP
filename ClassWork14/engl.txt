This book is addressed to everyone who studies Russian. But it does not consist of rules, exercises and educational texts. Other great textbooks have been created for this purpose.
This book has a completely different task. It will help you learn not only to speak, but also to think in Russian. The book you are holding in your hands is made up of aphorisms and reflections of great thinkers, writers, poets, philosophers and public figures of various eras. Their thoughts are about those issues that never cease to worry humanity.
You can agree or disagree with what you read in this book. It may seem to you that some thoughts are already outdated. But you should definitely think about and justify why you think so.
